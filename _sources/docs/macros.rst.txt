Helper Macros
==============

All macros in the library starts with `CESTER_`.

CESTER_TEST
------------

The macro for creating a test case. The macro takes care of initialization and declaration 
of the function and also takes care of the test case registration. The first parameter is the 
name of the test case, the second parameter is the TestInstance object to share data and 
command line arguments and the third is the test case body.

During the compile time code generation process the first time the macro is expanded it 
declare the test case function, in the second expansion it registered the test case function 
in the static array and in the final expansion the test case function is initialized. 

For the test case below:

.. code:: text

    CESTER_TEST(test_case_name, test_instance, 
        cester_assert_nothing();
    )

First Expansion 

.. code:: text

    static void cester_test_test_case_name(TestInstance* test_instance);

Second Expansion 

.. code:: text

    static TestCase cester_test_cases[] = {
        { CESTER_RESULT_UNKNOWN, __LINE__, CESTER_RESULT_SUCCESS, 0.000, 0.000, (char*) "", 
        (char*) "test_case_name", (cester_test_test_case_name), NULL, NULL, CESTER_NORMAL_TEST }
    }

Final Expansion 

.. code:: text

    static void cester_test_test_case_name(TestInstance* test_instance) {
        cester_assert_nothing();
    }


Therefore after the final expansion the source code will have transformed to this

.. code:: text

    static void cester_test_test_case_name(TestInstance* test_instance);

    static TestCase cester_test_cases[] = {
        { CESTER_RESULT_UNKNOWN, __LINE__, CESTER_RESULT_SUCCESS, 0.000, 0.000, (char*) "", 
        (char*) #x, (cester_test_test_case_name), NULL, NULL, CESTER_NORMAL_TEST }
    }

    static void cester_test_test_case_name(TestInstance* test_instance) {
        cester_assert_nothing();
    }


CESTER_TODO_TEST
-----------------

Work the same as the CESTER_TEST macro but the test type is CESTER_NORMAL_TODO_TEST. 
Test case declared with this macro is not executed but it reported as todo test.

.. code:: text

    CESTER_TODO_TEST(a_test_to_implement, test_instance,

    )

This macro is most useful for Test Driven Development (TDD). It create test cases for 
ops that has not been implemented yet.


CESTER_SKIP_TEST
-----------------

Work the same as the CESTER_TEST macro but the test type is CESTER_NORMAL_SKIP_TEST. 
Test case declared with this macro is not executed but it reported as skipped test.

.. code:: text

    CESTER_SKIP_TEST(a_test_to_implement, test_instance,
        
    )

There are various reason to creat a test with this macro, an example is running the test 
file in an environment where the resources needed by the test case is not available.

CESTER_BEFORE_ALL
-------------------

The function to setup the test resources before running the test case. It accepts the 
TestInstance object as the first parameter. The TestInstance parameter can be used to share
data and object between the test cases.

.. code:: text

    CESTER_BEFORE_ALL(test_instance,
        test_instance->arg = "beforeall";
    )

    CESTER_TEST(test_case, test_instance,
        cester_assert_str_equal((char*)(test_instance->arg), "beforeall");
    )

.. note:: 

    If you have any of CESTER_BEFORE_ALL, CESTER_BEFORE_EACH, CESTER_AFTER_ALL and 
    CESTER_AFTER_EACH. Your test cases will be executed on a single process to allow 
    shared objects. 

CESTER_BEFORE_EACH
-------------------

Use the macro to create a function that is invoked before each test case is executed. 
It accepts the TestInstance object as the first parameter, the current test name as the 
second parameter, the test case index as the third parameter.

.. code:: text

    CESTER_BEFORE_EACH(test_instance, test_name, index,
        if (test_name == "test_xml") {
            test_instance->arg = (void*) fopen("./result.xml", "r");

        } else if (test_name == "test_json") {
            test_instance->arg = (void*) fopen("./result.json", "r");
        }
    )

This macro can be used to setup resources according to the test case.

.. note:: 

    If you have any of CESTER_BEFORE_ALL, CESTER_BEFORE_EACH, CESTER_AFTER_ALL and 
    CESTER_AFTER_EACH. Your test cases will be executed on a single process to allow 
    shared objects. 

CESTER_AFTER_EACH
-------------------

Use the macro to create a function that is invoked after each test case is executed. 
It accepts the TestInstance object as the first parameter, the current test name as the 
second parameter, the test case index as the third parameter.

.. code:: text

    CESTER_AFTER_EACH(test_instance, test_name, index,
        if (test_name == "test_xml" || test_name == "test_json") {
            fclose((FILE*)(test_instance->arg));
        }
    )

This macro can be used to tear down resources according to the test case.

.. note:: 

    If you have any of CESTER_BEFORE_ALL, CESTER_BEFORE_EACH, CESTER_AFTER_ALL and 
    CESTER_AFTER_EACH. Your test cases will be executed on a single process to allow 
    shared objects. 

CESTER_AFTER_ALL
-------------------

The function to tear down the test resources after running the test case. It accepts the 
TestInstance object as the first parameter. This macro should be used to clean up shared 
object and close opened resources.

.. code:: text

    CESTER_AFTER_ALL(test_instance,
        free(test_instance->arg);
    )

.. note:: 

    If you have any of CESTER_BEFORE_ALL, CESTER_BEFORE_EACH, CESTER_AFTER_ALL and 
    CESTER_AFTER_EACH. Your test cases will be executed on a single process to allow 
    shared objects. 


CESTER_OPTIONS
---------------

This macro should be used to set the options accepted by cester. The function is executed 
before any of the setup functions and the test case. 

.. code:: text

    CESTER_OPTIONS(
        CESTER_NOCOLOR();
        CESTER_NO_ISOLATION();
        CESTER_OUTPUT_JUNITXML();
    )


CESTER_COMMENT
---------------

A multiline comment macro everything in the macro is printed out at the beginning of the test. 
Comma in the content will cause issue in the macro expansion when the code is compiled with C version less than C99. 
It should not begin or end in quote, escape characters is expanded when printed out

.. code:: text

    CESTER_COMMENT(
        This is a multiline comment in \n
        the source code this text is printed out \n
        before any test cases is executed.
    )

CESTER_REPORT_SUCCESS_REGARDLESS
---------------------------------

Always mark the test as success even if the test cases failed or an error occur while running the test.

.. code:: c

    CESTER_OPTIONS(
        CESTER_REPORT_SUCCESS_REGARDLESS();
    )

CESTER_REPORT_FAILURE_REGARDLESS
---------------------------------

Always mark the test as failure even if the test cases passes and no error occur.

.. code:: c

    CESTER_OPTIONS(
        CESTER_REPORT_FAILURE_REGARDLESS();
    )


CESTER_REGISTER_TEST
----------------------

Manually register a test case. For a compiler that does not have the __BASE_FILE__ macro 
defined the test case won't be registered at compile time, the test cases can be registered 
at runtime using this macro.

    CESTER_TEST(test_case_name, test_instance, 
        cester_assert_nothing();
    )

    CESTER_BODY(
    int main(int argc, char** argv) {
        CESTER_REGISTER_TEST(test_case_name);
        return CESTER_RUN_ALL_TESTS(argc, argv);
    }
    )


CESTER_REGISTER_SKIP_TEST
--------------------------

will be reported in result and logged under skipped tests.

.. code:: text

    CESTER_SKIP_TEST(test_case_name, test_instance, 
        cester_assert_nothing();
    )

    int main(int argc, char** argv) {
        CESTER_REGISTER_SKIP_TEST(test_case_name);
        return CESTER_RUN_ALL_TESTS(argc, argv);
    }
    )


CESTER_REGISTER_TODO_TEST
--------------------------

        cester_assert_nothing();
    )

    CESTER_BODY(
    int main(int argc, char** argv) {
        CESTER_REGISTER_TODO_TEST(test_case_name);
        return CESTER_RUN_ALL_TESTS(argc, argv);

        CESTER_REGISTER_BEFORE_ALL();
        return CESTER_RUN_ALL_TESTS(argc, argv);
    }
    )

.. warning::

    The test cases registered at compile time are ignored if at least one test case 
    is registered at run time with this macro.

    CESTER_BODY(
    int main(int argc, char** argv) {
        CESTER_REGISTER_AFTER_ALL();
        return CESTER_RUN_ALL_TESTS(argc, argv);
    }
    )

        return CESTER_RUN_ALL_TESTS(argc, argv);
    }
    )

        return CESTER_RUN_ALL_TESTS(argc, argv);
    }
    )

.. warning::

CESTER_TEST_SHOULD
-------------------

Set the expected result of a test case.  It accept the test case name as the first paramater, 
it accepts the expected result as the second parameter. The expected result mush be one of the 
enum types 

- CESTER_RESULT_SUCCESS
- CESTER_RESULT_FAILURE
- CESTER_RESULT_TERMINATED
- CESTER_RESULT_SEGFAULT
- CESTER_RESULT_MEMORY_LEAK
- CESTER_RESULT_UNRELEASED_STREAM

.. code:: text 

    CESTER_TEST(test_case_name, test_instance, 
        
    )

    CESTER_OPTIONS(
        CESTER_TEST_SHOULD(test_case_name, CESTER_RESULT_SUCCESS);
    )


CESTER_TEST_SHOULD_SEGFAULT
-----------------------------

Change the expected result of a test case to Segfault. If the test segfault then it passes. 
If it does not segfault it is marked as failed. It accept the test case name as paramater.

.. code:: text 

    CESTER_TEST(test_case_name, test_instance, 
        int *p = NULL;
        *p=0xdead;
    )

    CESTER_OPTIONS(
        CESTER_TEST_SHOULD_SEGFAULT(test_case_name);
    )


CESTER_TEST_SHOULD_FAIL
-------------------------

Change the expected result of a test case to failure. If the test case passed then it marked 
as failure. If it failed then it consider as passed. It accept the test case name as paramater. 

.. code:: text 

    CESTER_TEST(test_case_name, test_instance, 
        cester_assert_not_equal(NULL, ((void*)0));
    )

    CESTER_OPTIONS(
        CESTER_TEST_SHOULD_FAIL(test_case_name);
    )


CESTER_TEST_SHOULD_BE_TERMINATED
---------------------------------

Change the expected test case result. If the test case is terminated by user or another 
program then it passes ortherwise it fails. It accept the test case name as paramater.

.. code:: text 

    CESTER_TEST(test_case_name, test_instance, 
        while (1) {
            
        }
    )

    CESTER_OPTIONS(
        CESTER_TEST_SHOULD_BE_TERMINATED(test_case_name);
    )


CESTER_TEST_SHOULD_LEAK_MEMORY
---------------------------------

Change the expected test case result. If the test case does not leak any memory then the 
test case is marked as failure. It accept the test case name as paramater.

.. code:: text 

    CESTER_TEST(test_case_name, test_instance, 
        char* str = (char*) malloc(sizeof(char) * 12);
    )

    CESTER_OPTIONS(
        CESTER_TEST_SHOULD_LEAK_MEMORY(test_case_name);
    )

.. note:: 
    
    This macro is not available if the macro CESTER_NO_MEM_TEST is defined


CESTER_TEST_SHOULD_NOT_RELEASE_STREAM
--------------------------------------

Change the expected test case result. If the test case does not have any unreleased stream 
or no stream was captured the test case is marked as failure. It accept the test case name as paramater.

.. code:: text 

    CESTER_TEST(test_stream_capture, test_instance, 
        CESTER_CAPTURE_STREAM(stdout);
    )

    CESTER_OPTIONS(
        CESTER_TEST_SHOULD_NOT_RELEASE_STREAM(test_case_name);
    )

.. note:: 
    
    This macro is not available if the macro CESTER_NO_MEM_TEST is defined


#define CESTER_NO_MOCK
-----------------------

Define the macro CESTER_NO_MOCK to prevent mocking functions in the test. Even if mocked 
function are defined. This is not a predefined macro it has to be defined in the test source before including cester.h.

CESTER_MOCK_SIMPLE_FUNCTION
----------------------------

Mock a function that simply return a value. The macro accepts three parameters, the function 
identifier and parameters, the return type and the value to return when the function is 
invoked. For example mocking a function that return an integer:

.. code:: text

    int multiply_by() {
        return 2;
    }


To function above returns 2, the macro CESTER_MOCK_SIMPLE_FUNCTION can mock this function to 
return 5 instead of two:

.. code:: text

    CESTER_MOCK_SIMPLE_FUNCTION(multiply_by(), int, 5)


The macro above expands to the following code 

.. code:: text

    //...
    __attribute__((weak)) int multiply_by(); int __real_multiply_by();
    //...
    int __wrap_multiply_by() { return 5; }


CESTER_MOCK_FUNCTION
--------------------

This macro is similar to the CESTER_MOCK_SIMPLE_FUNCTION macro but instead of return a single 
value it accepts function body as the third argument. It accepts three parameters, the first is 
the function name and parameters, the second is the return type and the thrid is the function 
body. For example the function below does not return the correct power of value of an integer:

.. code:: text

    int power_of(int* num1, int num2) {
        return *num1 * num2;
    }


We then mock the function in the snippet below to properly calculate the power of an integer:

.. code:: text

    CESTER_MOCK_FUNCTION(power_of(int* num1, int num2), int, 
        int return_val = *num1;
        while (num2-->1) {
            return_val *= *num1;
        }
        return return_val;
    )


The macro above expands to the following code 

.. code:: text

    //...
    __attribute__((weak)) int power_of(int* num1, int num2); int __real_power_of(int* num1, int num2);
    //...
    int __wrap_power_of(int* num1, int num2) { 
        int return_val = *num1;
        while (num2-->1) {
            return_val *= *num1;
        }
        return return_val;
    }

CESTER_CAPTURE_STREAM
-----------------------

Use this macro to prepare a file stream to be captured by libcester, if a stream is not captured all 
assertion will fail for that stream. This simply make the stream address to point to another stream 
that is accessible and can be freely modified by cester.

.. code:: text

    CESTER_TEST(test_stream_capture, test_instance, 
        CESTER_CAPTURE_STREAM(stdout);
        //...
        CESTER_RELEASE_STREAM(stdout);
    )

If the stream that the output is written into **(stdout by default)** is captured if it not released 
at the end of the test case it will be forcefully released to libcester can continue writing the to the 
stream to see the test results.

CESTER_RELEASE_STREAM
-----------------------

Release a stream that has been captured by cester, this simply change the address of the stream to point 
to the original stream value, and the temporary stream used for testing is deleted from the file system.
It very important to release a captured stream else stream might not give expected output if used in 
other test case, and if recaptured the original stream is lost forever in memory.

Always write the release statement at the point o capture and place the code in between. If you fail to 
release captured stream the test case will fail with `CESTER_RESULT_UNRELEASED_STREAM` error.

CESTER_RESET_STREAM
-----------------------

Remove all the existing data written to a stream so new data is not appended.

CESTER_CHANGE_STREAM_CAPTURE_TM_FOLDER
---------------------------------------

Change the folder used to hold the temporary files used for the streams captured. It accept the folder 
as the only parameter, the folder must exist on the file system and must be readable and writable.

The default location on windows is determined by the return value of `getenv("TEMP")` if not set the 
folder *"C:/libcester_tmp/"* is used. On other platforms the value of `getenv("TMPDIR")` is used and 
if not set the fallback folder is *"/tmp/libcester_tmp/"*.

CESTER_CAPTURE_STDOUT
-------------------------

Capture the stdout stream, alias for `CESTER_CAPTURE_STREAM(stdout)`.

CESTER_RELEASE_STDOUT
-------------------------

Release the stdout stream, alias for `CESTER_RELEASE_STREAM(stdout)`.

CESTER_RESET_STDOUT
-------------------------

Reset the stdout stream, alias for `CESTER_RESET_STREAM(stdout)`.

CESTER_CAPTURE_STDERR
-------------------------

Capture the stderr stream, alias for `CESTER_CAPTURE_STREAM(stderr)`.

CESTER_RELEASE_STDERR
-------------------------

Release the stderr stream, alias for `CESTER_RELEASE_STREAM(stderr)`.

CESTER_RESET_STDERR
-------------------------

Reset the stderr stream, alias for `CESTER_RESET_STREAM(stderr)`.

CESTER_CAPTURE_STDIN
-------------------------

Capture the stdin stream, alias for `CESTER_CAPTURE_STREAM(stdin)`.

CESTER_RELEASE_STDIN
-------------------------

Release the stdin stream, alias for `CESTER_RELEASE_STREAM(stdin)`.

CESTER_RESET_STDIN
-------------------------

Reset the stdin stream, alias for `CESTER_RESET_STREAM(stdin)`.

#define CESTER_NO_MAIN
-----------------------

Define this macro before including cester.h to use your own custom main function. This still 
requires you to put your main function in the CESTER_BODY macro. To run the tests invoke the 
macro `CESTER_RUN_ALL_TESTS(argc, argv)` with the two main function parameter. 

#define CESTER_NO_PRINT_INFO
--------------------------------

Defining this macro will remove the printing test information feature during compilation step, 
the flag `--cester-info=`, function `cester_str_size` will not be available at runtime. 
This is not a predefined macro it has to be defined in the test source before including cester.h.

CESTER_BODY
---------------

This macro wraps codes in test file to prevent generating the codes more than once. 
Any code block not in one of the test macros should be placed in this macro. Putting 
code in the file without wraping it with CESTER_BODY will cause issues during compilation.

The following code will cause compilation issues.

.. code:: text

    #include <exotic/cester.h>
    
    int an_integer = 20;

The solution is to wrap the statement in CESTER_BODY

.. code:: text

    #include <exotic/cester.h>
    
    CESTER_BODY(
    int an_integer = 20;
    )

Another good example is defining the entry point for the test instead of relying on cester 
main function. After defining the `CESTER_NO_MAIN` your main function must be wrapped 
inside *CESTER_BODY* macro to avoid error. 

.. code:: text

    #define CESTER_NO_MAIN
    #include <exotic/cester.h>

    CESTER_BEFORE_ALL(test_instance,
        cester_assert_equal(1, 1);
    )

    CESTER_BODY(
    int main(int argc, char **argv) {
        return CESTER_RUN_ALL_TESTS(argc, argv);
    }
    )

Any code written inside the *CESTER_BODY* macro will be dumb in the file global scope. This macro 
should not contain other `CESTER_` macros.


#define CESTER_NO_MEM_TEST
---------------------------

Define the macro CESTER_NO_MEM_TEST to disable cester memory allocation test at compile time. 
The option `--cester-nomemtest` can be applied to the command line to stop mem test at runtime. 
This is not a predefined macro it has to be defined in the test source before including cester.h.


#define CESTER_NO_SIGNAL
--------------------------

Disable error handling with signal.h


#define CESTER_NO_TIME
---------------------------

Define the macro CESTER_NO_TIME to disable time keeping and floating point in your test. This comes 
handy in microcontrollers which does not have a proper time keeping library and has no floating 
point types support (but likely using compiler older than C90). 

This macro was added in `PR 14 <https://github.com/exoticlibraries/libcester/pull/14>`_ by 
`nicolasnoble <https://github.com/nicolasnoble>`_.


#define CESTER_EXCLUDE_WINDOWS_H
---------------------------------

Define the macro CESTER_EXCLUDE_WINDOWS_H to prevent the inclusion of the `windows.h` header file.
Use this to get around conflicts in the windows API and your test.

CESTER_CHANGE_STREAM
---------------------

Change the stream where the ouput is written to, the default value is the standard output 
`stdout`, the macro accepts one argument which is the stream to use. The example below shows 
how to write the test result to a file 'result.txt':

.. code:: text

    CESTER_BEFORE_ALL(test_instance,
        FILE* output = fopen("./result.txt", "w+");
        CESTER_CHANGE_STREAM(output);
    )

The result of the test will be written into the file 'result.txt'. The ouput stream changes 
at which point the macro is used, hence output written before changing the stream will 
remain and the new output will be written to the new stream.

CESTER_NOCOLOR
--------------

.. code:: text

    CESTER_NO_COLOR()

Prevent displaying the output with colors. This option can prevent writing extra bytes into 
an output file in place of the color values. The option can also be set from the cli using 
`--cester-nocolor`. 

CESTER_VERBOSE_LEVEL
---------------------

.. code:: text

    CESTER_VERBOSE_LEVEL(3)

Change the verbose level of the output, the higher the velue the more the information 
printed into the terminal. 0 value means no output apart from the testcase's and value 
4 and above prints the full path to the test file. The option can also be set from the 
cli using `--cester-verbose-level=3`. 

The verbose level ranges from 0 to 10, zero being the lowest and 10 the highest. With 
verbose level of zero no information is printed in the terminal, with 10 all possible 
information is printed in the terminal. 3 is the best value to print out meaningful 
details.

CESTER_PRINT_ERROR_ONLY
-------------------------

.. code:: text

    CESTER_PRINT_ERROR_ONLY()

Print only error in the terminal, ignore assertions, evaluation result.

CESTER_MINIMAL
---------------

.. code:: text

    CESTER_MINIMAL()

Print minimal info into the output stream. With this option set the expression evaluated 
will not be printed in the result output. The option can also be set from the cli using 
`--cester-minimal`.

This is equivaluent to setting the verbose level to the lowest value 
`--cester-verbose-level=0`. No information is printed into the terminal.

CESTER_VERBOSE
---------------

.. code:: text

    CESTER_VERBOSE()

Print as much info as possible into the output stream. With this option set both passed 
and failed expression evaluated will be printed in the result. The option can also be set 
from the cli using `--cester-verbose`. 

This is equivaluent to setting the verbose level to the highest value 
`--cester-verbose-level=10`. All possible information is printed into the terminal with the 
full path of the test file.

CESTER_PRINT_VERSION
---------------------

.. code:: text

    CESTER_PRINT_VERSION()

Print cester version before running any test. The option can also be set from the cli 
using `--cester-printversion`.

CESTER_SINGLE_OUPUT_ONLY
-------------------------

.. code:: text

    CESTER_SINGLE_OUPUT_ONLY()

Display test for a single test case only, skip syntesis and summary. This option can also be 
set from the command line with `--cester-singleoutput`

CESTER_NO_ISOLATION
---------------------

.. code:: text

    CESTER_NO_ISOLATION()

Do not isolate the tests, run each of the test cases in a single process. The drawback is 
if a test case causes segfault or crash the entire test crashes and no summary is displayed. 
No isolation causes a crash one crash all scenerio.
    
This option can also be set from the command line with `--cester-noisolation`

CESTER_NO_MEMTEST
---------------------

.. code:: text

    CESTER_NO_MEMTEST()

Disable memory leak detection test. This option can also be set from the command line 
with `--cester-nomemtest`

CESTER_DO_MEMTEST
---------------------

.. code:: text

    CESTER_SINGLE_OUPUT_ONLY()

Enable memory allocation. The combination of CESTER_NO_MEMTEST() and  CESTER_DO_MEMTEST() 
is valid only in non isolated tests. 

This togle combined with `CESTER_NO_MEMTEST()` can be used to selectively test memory 
allocation in a test e.g. Calling CESTER_NO_MEMTEST() before a test case will prevent memory 
test from the beginning of that function and calling CESTER_DO_MEMTEST() at the end of the 
test case will ensure memory allocation will be validated in all the other test case that follows.

CESTER_OUTPUT_TEXT
---------------------

.. code:: text

    CESTER_OUTPUT_TEXT()

Change the output format to text. This option can also be set from the command line 
with `--cester-format=text`


CESTER_OUTPUT_JUNITXML
-----------------------

.. code:: text

    CESTER_OUTPUT_JUNITXML()

Change the output format to junitxml. This option can also be set from the command line 
with `--cester-format=junitxml`


CESTER_OUTPUT_TAP
-----------------------

.. code:: text

    CESTER_OUTPUT_TAP()

Change the output format to TAP (Test Anything Protocol). This option can also be set from 
the command line with `--cester-format=tap`


CESTER_OUTPUT_TAPV13
-----------------------

.. code:: text

    CESTER_OUTPUT_TAPV13()

Change the output format to TAP (Test Anything Protocol) Version 13. This option can also 
be set from the command line with `--cester-format=tapV13`


CESTER_FORMAT_TESTNAME
-----------------------

.. code:: text

    CESTER_FORMAT_TESTNAME()

Format the test case name for output. E.g the test name  `modify_test_instance` becomes 
`modify test instance`. This does not apply to junitxml as the test name remain the way it declared in the test 
source.


CESTER_DONT_FORMAT_TESTNAME
-----------------------------

.. code:: text

    CESTER_DONT_FORMAT_TESTNAME()

Do not format the test case name, it remain the way it declared in the test source. 
This option can also be set from the command line with `--cester-dontformatname`

Error that occur within a test case is reported for that test case


CESTER_TOTAL_TESTS_RAN
-------------------------

.. code:: text

    printf("Current Total Test Ran %d", CESTER_TOTAL_TESTS_RAN);

The total number of test that was executed. In cases where specific test cases is selected from the cli it value might not be equal the value of CESTER_TOTAL_TESTS_COUNT. 
If specific test cases is selected, if any of the selected test cases does not exist it will not count only the executed test cases counts.
